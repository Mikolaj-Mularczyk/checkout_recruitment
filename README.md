# Checkout.com Basket Manager

The project with web api is the BasketManager project.

The client library (BasketManager.Client) was generated with NSwag.

You can test the application using the SampleClient project.

I have added a Jwt authentication with dummy login returning a token. In real scenario, some different service would take care of checking the validity of a token.
